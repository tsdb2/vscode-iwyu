# `vscode-iwyu`

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tsdb2/vscode-iwyu)](https://github.com/tsdb2/vscode-iwyu/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Overview

A VS Code extension by TSDB2 to run [IWYU](https://include-what-you-use.org/) on C++ files.

Currently under development and not yet published.

This extension requires that your build setup generate a
[JSON compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html). If you use
Bazel you can try [`comp_db_hook`](https://github.com/tsdb2/comp_db_hook) to generate it and keep it
up-to-date at every build.

## Installation

Clone the repository and `cd` into it.

Install the dependencies:

```sh
vscode-iwyu$ npm install
```

Compile and package the extension:

```sh
$ npx vsce package
```

Then open VS Code, hit Ctrl+Shift+X to navigate to the extensions page, click "Install from VSIX..."
in the menu, and pick the .vsix file generated by `vsce`.
